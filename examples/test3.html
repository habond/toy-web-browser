    <h1>Long Text Example</h1>

    <p>
        This is a longer paragraph to test text wrapping. The toy browser should
        properly wrap this text when it exceeds the viewport width. Lorem ipsum
        dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor
        incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
        consequat.

    <h2>Multiple Paragraphs</h2>

    <p>
        First paragraph here. It contains some normal text that should be
        rendered with proper spacing between paragraphs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Second paragraph here. Notice how there's vertical spacing between
        this and the previous paragraph. This helps with readability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third paragraph with <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and even
        <code>inline code snippets</code> mixed in. The renderer should
        handle all these different styles correctly.
    </p>

    <h3>Nested Elements</h3>

    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is inside a div element.</p>
        <div>
            <p>This is a nested div with its own paragraph.</p>
            <p>And another paragraph in the same nested div.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Back to the outer div.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <h4>Quote Header</h4>
        <p>
            This is a blockquote with multiple elements inside it.
            It should be visually distinct from regular paragraphs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Even lists can be inside blockquotes</li>
            <li>Like this one</li>
        </ul>
